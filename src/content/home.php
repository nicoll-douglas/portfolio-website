  <h1>Hi, I'm Nicoll</h1>
  <p>I'm a full-stack web developer based in London driven by my philosophy of “building as I learn, learning as I build, succeeding as I grow”. I develop efficient and robust applications for the web and have an eagerness to keep expanding my skills, not only as a developer, but as a creator and collaborator.</p>
