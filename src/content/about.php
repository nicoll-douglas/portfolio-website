    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm currently a full-time undergraduate student at Queen Mary University of London studying Computer Science. My journey in tech began with a strong focus on web dev, where I spent time honing my skills and creating straightforward digital experiences with the likes of React and PHP.</p>
    <p>As witnessed, I actively like to branch out and explore other exciting realms of the tech world such as DevOps and networking, supplementing higher education and broadening my understanding of how software is built, deployed, and connected.</p>
