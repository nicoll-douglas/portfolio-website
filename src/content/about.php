    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I'm currently a full-time undergraduate student at Queen Mary University of London studying Computer Science. My journey in tech began with a strong focus on web development, where I spent time honing my skills and creating straightforward digital experiences with the likes of React and PHP.</p>

    <p>As someone who likes to tinker around and learn new things, I'm now actively branching out and exploring other exciting realms of the tech world such as DevOps and networking, broadening my understanding of how software is built, deployed, and connected.</p>
